// wrong one at three — a card wide enough to say "Keep awake" and
// choosing not to is just a card you have to hover to understand. At
// one cell the glyph is not on a badge any more but on the card, so
// the card itself fills when it is on.

    // Forty rather than seventy, for the same reason ConnRow dropped
    // to it: the panel is six square cells now, and a two-cell row is
