cat <<'NOTE'

One thing this script deliberately does not do:

  · It doesn't write ~/.config/island/settings.json. That file is
    machine state and is created on first run from the defaults in
    Services/Config.qml. New keys merge in automatically on start;
    delete the file only if you want to take new defaults for keys
    you already have. settings.example.json shows every key.

It DOES now set your GTK theme, which it used to leave to you. The
shell owns ~/.config/gtk-{3,4}.0/gtk.css and imports the generated
colours from matugen.css next to it; put your own CSS in user.css in
the same directory and it will be imported after both.

Continuous four-finger gestures need read access to the input devices:

    sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"

That takes effect at your next login. Without it island-gestures
exits quietly and the gestures simply do nothing.

Log out and pick Hyprland at your display manager.
NOTE
